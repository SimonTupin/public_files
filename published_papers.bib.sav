  abstract      = {Contemporary paradigm of vascular hemodynamics considers normal blood flow to be pulsatile laminar flow. Transition to turbulence can cause diseases such as atherosclerosis or brain aneurysms. Recently, we demonstrated the existence of turbulence in experimental models of brain aneurysm; in the aneurysm sac as well as in the main artery. Thus, we were intrigued to explore if such a long-standing assumption of the laminarity of blood flow could be challenged. We have used methods and tools from chaos theory, hydrodynamic stability theory and turbulence physics to explore the existence of turbulence in normal vascular blood flow. We used Womersley exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equation with the HaeMed database of physiologic blood flow measurements, to offer reproducible evidence for our findings, as well as evidence from Doppler ultrasound measurements from healthy volunteers. The tools we used to investigate the properties of blood turbulence are well established in the fields of chaos theory, hydrodynamic stability and turbulence dynamics. We show, evidently, that blood flow is inherently chaotic and turbulent and not laminar. We propose a paradigm shift in the theory of vascular hemodynamics which requires rethinking the hemodynamic-biologic links governing physiologic and pathologic processes.},

  abstract      = {The genesis, growth and rupture of intracranial aneurysm (IA) are open questions in neurovascular medicine until the present moment. The complexity of aneurysm mechanobiology and pathobiology staggeringly combine intertwining biological and physical processes that are tightly connected. Recently, transition to turbulence in IA blood flow is thought to play a central role in IA growth and rupture as it can be directly linked to endothelial dysfunction. However, the problem of turbulence brings unprecedented complications to the topic. We found turbulence in IA to be of non-Kolmogorov type. For the first time, we detected inverse kinetic energy cascade in blood flow and in non-Kolmogorov turbulence. Here, we hypothesize that the near-wall turbulence undergoing inverse energy cascade have scales that could affect the mechano-signaling of endothelial cells. Our findings could be a paradigm shift in the contemporary theory of aneurysm hemodynamics.},

  abstract     = {{Endovascular treatment has become the standard for intracranial aneurysm management. In vitro systems including an artery model are required for devices evaluation and clinician training. Although silicone is usually use for such model, its compliance is known to be lower than blood vessels. The purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of model material compliance on flow properties.Silicone and 12 [wt\%] poly (vinyl alcohol) hydrogel (PVA-H) were used to create two box-shaped models of significantly different compliance. The inner lumen geometry was a 4 [mm] diameter straight tube (parent vessel) and a 10 [mm] diameter sphere representing the aneurysm. A blood-mimicking fluid made of a mixture of glycerin, water and sodium iodide was used to reproduce the viscosity and density of blood and fit models refractive index. The circulation system consisted of a pulsatile blood pump and resistance valve. A flow rate of 250±50 [ml/min] and pressure from 75 to 115 [mmHg] were set inside the model. Pressure and flow rate sensors were used to monitor flow conditions before and after the model. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was performed to record the difference of flow patterns inside the aneurysm of both model using a Nd:YAG solid laser system and fluorescent particles.Results revealed a significant change of flow conditions due to model compliance. Attenuation of the flow rate pulse was recorded between the inlet and the outlet of the both model. This attenuation was 51\% for PVA-H model. Moreover, a time lag between outlet pressure and outlet flow rate curves was recorded in both model. This time lag was longer with the PVA-H model, as this model exhibit a greater compliance.PIV experiments revealed significant changes of flow patterns and velocity inside the aneurysm. Because of its high compliance, PVA-H model walls moved under the pulsatile conditions. A change of flow direction and decrease of its velocity were observed near the proximal wall of the aneurysm, compared to the silicone model. Such differences might modify the stress on the wall of the aneurysm.To conclude, our experiments revealed that compliance has significant impacts on flow properties and should be taken into account for in vitro vascular model manufacturing.}"},
